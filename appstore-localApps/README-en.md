rm -rf /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/appstore-localApps
```

Then refresh the local applications in the app store.

#### 2.1.2 Getting Apps via Compressed Package

In the `Shell Script` task type in the `1Panel` scheduled tasks, add and execute the following command, or run the following command in the terminal:

```shell
wget -P /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local https://mirror.ghproxy.com/https://github.com/okxlin/appstore/archive/refs/heads/localApps.zip

unzip -o -d /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/ /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/localApps.zip

cp -rf /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/appstore-localApps/apps/* /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/

rm -rf /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/appstore-localApps

rm -rf /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/localApps.zip
```

Then refresh the local applications in the app store.

### 2.2 International Network

#### 2.2.1 Getting Apps via Git Command

In the `Shell Script` task type in the `1Panel` scheduled tasks, add and execute the following command, or run the following command in the terminal:

```shell
git clone -b localApps https://github.com/okxlin/appstore /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/appstore-localApps

cp -rf /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/appstore-localApps/apps/* /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/

rm -rf /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/appstore-localApps
```

Then refresh the local applications in the app store.

#### 2.2.2 Getting Apps via Compressed Package

```shell
wget -P /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local https://github.com/okxlin/appstore/archive/refs/heads/localApps.zip

unzip -o -d /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/ /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/localApps.zip

cp -rf /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/appstore-localApps/apps/* /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/

rm -rf /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/appstore-localApps

rm -rf /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/localApps.zip
```

Then refresh the local applications in the app store.

## 3. Remarks

**If an application is not displayed in the local app list, it means it has not been fully adapted for operation in the app store panel.**

**However, it can still be run directly in the terminal.**

> Most applications in this repository support running directly with `docker-compose up`

Taking `rustdesk` as an example:

```shell
# Enter the latest version directory of rustdesk
cd /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/rustdesk/versions/latest/

# Copy .env.sample as .env
cp .env.sample .env

# Edit the .env file and modify the parameters
nano .env

# Start RustDesk
docker-compose up -d

# View the necessary key for connecting
cat ./data/hbbs/id_ed25519.pub

```
