LinkStack: The Ultimate Link Management Solution

LinkStack is a unique platform that provides an efficient solution for managing and sharing links online. Our platform offers a website similar to Linktree, which allows users to overcome the limitation of only being able to add one link on social media platforms.

With LinkStack, users can easily link to their own custom page and provide their followers with access to all the links they need in one convenient location. What sets LinkStack apart from other link management platforms is its flexibility, which allows users to host their links on their own web server or web hosting provider. This provides users with complete control over their online presence and ensures that their links are easily accessible.

Additionally, LinkStack allows other users to register and create their own links, making it an ideal solution for businesses and organizations looking to manage multiple links. With our user-friendly Admin Panel, managing and accessing other users' links is easy.

## About

With LinkStack, our mission is to provide users with a free and privacy-focused solution for managing and sharing links online. We believe that everyone should have access to a customizable link-sharing platform without sacrificing their privacy and control over their data.

To achieve this mission, we offer a self-hosted option for users who want complete control over their data without having it sold to third-party companies. Our platform can be easily implemented through a simple **drag and drop** process, eliminating the need for complex terminal commands or source code manipulation.

For those who may not have the technical expertise to self-host, we also offer free instances of our platform while still prioritizing their privacy. Our platform offers many of the same features and options as commercial link-sharing platforms while maintaining the values of privacy and autonomy.

Our goal is to provide a free version of a link-sharing service, similar to Linktree, while empowering users to take ownership of their data. We will never sell user data and believe in providing a trustworthy and transparent solution for managing and sharing links online.
