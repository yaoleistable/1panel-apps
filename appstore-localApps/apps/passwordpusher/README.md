------

Give your users the tools to be secure by default.

Password Pusher is an opensource application to communicate passwords over the web. Links to passwords expire after a certain number of views and/or time has passed.

Hosted at [pwpush.com](https://pwpush.com) but you can also easily run your own private instance with just a few steps.

* __Easy-to-install:__ Host your own via Docker, a cloud service or just use [pwpush.com](https://pwpush.com)
* __Opensource:__ No blackbox code.  Only trusted, tested and reviewed opensource code.
* __Versatile:__ Push passwords, text, files or URLs that autoexpire and self delete.
* __Audit logging:__ Track and control what you've shared and see who has viewed it.
* __Encrypted storage:__ All sensitive data is stored encrypted and deleted entirely once expired.
* __Host your own:__ Database backed or ephemeral, easily run your own instance isolated from the world.
* __JSON API:__ Raw JSON API available for 3rd party tools or command line via `curl` or `wget`.
* __Command line interface:__ Automate your password distribution with CLI tools or custom scripts.
* __Logins__: Invite your colleagues and track what is pushed and who retrieved it.
* __Internationalized:__ 28 language translations are bundled in.  Easily selectable via UI or URL
* __Themes:__ [26 themes](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/blob/master/Themes.md) bundled in courtesy of Bootswatch.  Select with a simple environment variable.
* __Unbranded delivery page:__ No logos, superfluous text or unrelated links to confuse end users.

* __Rebrandable:__ Customize the site name, tagline and logo to fit your environment.

* __10 Years Old:__ Password Pusher has securely delivered millions and millions of passwords in its 10 year history.
* __Actively Maintained:__ I happily work for the good karma of the great IT/Security community.
* __Honest Software:__  Opensource written and maintained by [me](https://github.com/pglombardo) with the help of some great contributors.  No organizations, corporations or evil agendas.
